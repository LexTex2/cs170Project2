This dataset has 6 features (not including the class attribute), with 500 instances.
Running nearest neighbor with all 6 features, using "leaving-one-out" evaluation, I get an accuracy of 80%

Beginning search.
        Using feature(s) {2,3,4,5,6} accuracy is 84.2%
        Using feature(s) {1,3,4,5,6} accuracy is 84.2%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,4,5,6} accuracy is 86.4%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,3,5,6} accuracy is 85%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,3,4,6} accuracy is 74%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,3,4,5} accuracy is 69%

Removing feature {3} from feature set was best, accuracy is 86.4%
        Using feature(s) {2,4,5,6} accuracy is 87.4%
        Using feature(s) {1,4,5,6} accuracy is 89.2%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,5,6} accuracy is 90.4%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,4,6} accuracy is 77%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,4,5} accuracy is 75%

Removing feature {4} from feature set was best, accuracy is 90.4%
        Using feature(s) {2,5,6} accuracy is 94.6%
        Using feature(s) {1,5,6} accuracy is 95.6%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,6} accuracy is 76.2%
        Using feature(s) {1,2,5} accuracy is 74.6%

Removing feature {2} from feature set was best, accuracy is 95.6%
        Using feature(s) {5,6} accuracy is 97%
        Using feature(s) {1,6} accuracy is 79%
        Using feature(s) {1,5} accuracy is 72.4%

Removing feature {1} from feature set was best, accuracy is 97%
        Using feature(s) {6} accuracy is 83.6%
        Using feature(s) {5} accuracy is 76.6%

Removing feature {5} from feature set was best, accuracy is 83.6%
(Warning, accuracy has decreased! Continuing search in case of local maxima)

Removing feature {6} from feature set was best, accuracy is 80%

Finished search!! The best feature subset is {5,6} with an accuracy of 97%
