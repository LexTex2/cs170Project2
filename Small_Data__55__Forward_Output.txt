This dataset has 6 features (not including the class attribute), with 500 instances.
Running nearest neighbor with all 6 features, using "leaving-one-out" evaluation, I get an accuracy of 80%

Beginning search.

Feature set {6} was best, accuracy is 83.6%

        Using feature(s) {6} accuracy is 79%
